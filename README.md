# IDLEAlign
Python IDLE extension to align code by a regular expression

## Installation
1) Go to terminal and install with `pip install idlealign`.
2) Run command `idlealign`. You will likely see a message saying
`idlealign not in system registered extensions!`. Run the command
given to add lintcheck to your system's IDLE extension config file.
3) Again run command `idlealign`. This time, you should see the following
output: `Config should be good!`.
4) Open IDLE, go to `Options` -> `Configure IDLE` -> `Extensions`.
If everything went well, alongside `ZzDummy` there should be and
option called `idlealign`. This is where you can configure if
idlealign is enabled or not.
